Explanatory Data Analysis of Prosper Loan Data Set
--------------------------


This project is  connected to the <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/ud651">Data Analysis With R course</a> from Udacity and you can check my report <a href="http://ucaiado.github.io/ProsperLoan_EDA/" target="_blank">here</a>. I will conduct a exploratory data analysis on a data set that contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, borrower employment status, etc.

I have to conduct the analysis using R and I have to create an RMD file that explores the variables, structure, patterns, oddities, and underlying relationships of the data set. It is required that I explore the data and ask interesting questions about it.
